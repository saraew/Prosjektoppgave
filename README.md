# Prosjektoppgave
Code files and data from my spesialisation project for the industrial mathematics masters program at NTNU. 

By running the Main.R file, all parts of the project can be sourced separately. Just comment out files that are not applicable. 
All files depend on 
- "Functions.R" 

being runned. 
To run the simulation experiment, the "Sim_data.R" generates the synthetic data. 
This synthetic data will the be used to run both the sensitivity analysis and the experiments presented in 
my specialisation project at NTNU.
