# Spesialisation-project
Code files and data from my spesialisation project for the industrial mathematics masters program at NTNU. 

By running the Main.R file, all parts of the project can be sources separately. Just comment out files that are not applicable. 
All files depend on "Functions.R" being runned, but other than that they none of the scripts are dependent on each other.
