# Welcome to my specialisation project, a requirement for my study program of
# industrial mathematics at NTNU. 
# A considerable part of the code in this project (most of what is related to MCMC by using NIMBLE), 
# is produced by the authors of the paper "A Hierarchical Framework for Correcting Under-Reporting in Count Data", 
# and found in the supplementary material supporting that paper. 
# I have adapted the code to fit my application and model, but the credit should go to them. 
# This relates both to the simulation study and the application on Tuberculosis data.
